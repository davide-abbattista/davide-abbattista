## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Davide Abbattista

* I am a Data and Artificial Intelligence Researcher with a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science Engineering from the Polytechnic of Bari, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. During my academic journey, I collaborated on several team projects, sharpening my skills in AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, and Recommender Systems.
* As part of my masterâ€™s program, I completed a research period at the University of Glasgow, where I developed my thesis on Deep Learning. This research culminated in a paper published at RecSys â€™24. Additionally, my teamâ€™s contributions to the RecSys Challenge â€™24 were accepted for publication, reflecting our innovative work in recommender systems.
* My technical expertise centers on Python as my primary programming language, with extensive experience using the PyTorch ML library for developing and optimizing advanced machine learning models. I am passionate about leveraging AI technologies to tackle complex real-world challenges and am eager to contribute to innovative projects in this dynamic field.
